# Covariate-Modulated-Large-Scale-Multiple-Testing-under-Dependence
cmLIS is a procedure to perform testing tens of thousands of hypotheses simultaneously that not only takes into account local correlations among tests but also accommodates the covariate information by leveraging a covariate-modulated hidden Markov model (HMM).
